# Wireless Stress Detection Health Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time health monitoring system capable of detecting stress using biosensors. It collects physiological data such as ECG, heart rate, and temperature, processes it with machine learning models, and provides stress-level analysis. The system combines hardware components and cloud-based data handling to deliver accurate, real-time monitoring.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Collection**: Utilizes biosensors and Arduino to capture health metrics.
- **Stress Detection**: Leverages machine learning models to analyze stress levels.
- **Cloud Integration**: Firebase is used for storing and visualizing real-time data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and AdaBoost are employed for classification.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, NodeMCU ESP8266, and various biosensors (ECG, Heart Rate, Temperature).
- **Software**: Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase for real-time data storage.
- **Visualization**: Plots and dashboards using Python and cloud tools.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection**: Sensors collect vital health data.
- **Data Processing**: Data is preprocessed using Python scripts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained to classify stress levels based on physiological data.
- **Visualization**: Real-time insights are visualized using cloud dashboards and Python.
